**SERVER JUST LAUNCHED APRIL 16th!**

Sakaar is a city that is surrounded by numerous portals that deposit all sorts of things into and around the city. The exact nature of how it came to be is a bit of a mystery, even though it is hard to tell who, if anyone, is a native to the city, some have taken to calling themselves Sakaarans, due to having been in the city for as long as they can remember, in some cases for multiple generations.

Time in Sakaar flows differently, some say time is moving slower, others claim it is moving faster. The portals don't help with an answer as some seem to always send people to the same moment in time. Time must be progressing though as people are getting older and two objects can be seen passing through the sky, Aakar and Sabyr - The Broken Moon. It is claimed the moon was once whole and broken in two when the largest portal around Sakaar was formed and shattered it.

Coming to Sakaar is always a one-way trip. Once someone arrives they seem unable to leave for very long. Anyone that has ever tried leaving through a portal is eventually pulled back to Sakaar, no one quite knows why. Some claim they've passed through portals granting them years away before being pulled back, but other portals pull people back within minutes.

Now that you've arrived your fate is the same as everyone else, you're trapped. Will you accept your fate and resign yourself to life in Sakaar? Or will you join the search for the way out? Either way, welcome to **The Portal Realm**.
